    <p class="para1"> Subhas Bose was born into wealth and privilege in a large Bengali family in Orissa 
    during the British Raj. The early recipient of an Anglocentric education, 
    he was sent after college to England to take the Indian Civil Service examination. 
    He succeeded with distinction in the vital first exam but demurred at taking the routine final exam, 
    citing nationalism to be a higher calling. Returning to India in <b style="color: red;" > <u> 1921, </b></u> Bose joined the nationalist
     movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress. He followed Jawaharlal Nehru to 
     leadership in a group within the Congress which was less keen on constitutional reform and more open 
     to socialism. Bos e became Congress president in <u> <b font face="" color="red"> 1938.</u></b> After reelection in <b><u>1939,</u></b>  differences arose 
     between him and the Congress leaders, including Gandhi, over the future federation of British 
     India and princely states, but also because discomfort had grown among the Congress leadership 
     over Bose's negotiable attitude to non-violence, and his plans for greater powers for himself.</p><br>

<p class="para2"> In April <b>1941</b> Bose arrived in Nazi Germany, where the leadership offered unexpected but equivocal 
sympathy for India's independence. German funds were employed to open a Free India Centre in Berlin. 
A <del> <b>3,000</b></del>-strong Free India Legion was recruited from among Indian POWs captured by Erwin Rommel's Afrika 
Korps to serve under Bose. Although peripheral to their main goals, the Germans inconclusively considered 
a land invasion of India throughout <b> 1941.</b> By the spring of <b> 1942,</b> the German army was mired in Russia and 
Bose became keen to move to southeast Asia, where Japan had just won quick victories. Adolf Hitler during 
his only meeting with Bose in late May <b> 1942</b> offered to arrange a submarine. During this time, Bose became 
a father.</p> <br>

<p class="para2"> With Japanese support, Bose revamped the Indian National Army (INA), which comprised Indian prisoners 
of war of the Indian Army who had been captured by the Japanese in the Battle of Singapore. A Provisional 
Government of Free India was declared on the Japanese-occupied Andaman and Nicobar Islands and was 
nominally presided by Bose. Although Bose was unusually driven and charismatic, the Japanese considered 
him to be militarily unskilled,[ab] and his soldierly effort was short-lived. In late 1944 and early 1945, 
the Indian Army reversed the Japanese attack on India. Almost half the Japanese forces and the participating 
INA contingent were killed.The remaining INA was driven down the Malay Peninsula and surrendered with the 
recapture of Singapore. Bose chose to escape to Manchuria to seek a future in the Soviet Union which he 
believed to have turned anti-British.</p>
