                The story so far:
                O
                ver the past two months, a slew of
                U.S. multinational companies including tech giants Amazon, Meta,
                Intel, Twitter and financial behemoths like
                Citi and Morgan Stanley, announced massive layoffs. According to a global placement and coaching firm,
                the layoffs
                crossed 60,000 in September and October. These developments are bound to have
                an impact, on India’s export prospects, especially in the information technology (IT)
                sector.
                Why are layoffs becoming common?
                Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai had warned
                of a coming winter in the tech sector earlier this year. In an all­hands meeting in
                September this year, one of his responses
                to staff queries on budget cuts was: “We
                don’t get to choose the macroeconomic
                conditions always.” A potential economic
                recession is a big red flag. With inflation
                soaring in most parts of the world, central
                banks have been scrambling since March
                this year to rein it in by increasing rates so
                as to make it more costly to borrow and
                consume. This will eventually affect economic growth and jobs. The International
                Monetary Fund (IMF) has cited forecasts
                for global GDP growth in both 2022 and
                2023 as gloomy, given the pandemic and
                ongoing Russia­Ukraine war. Setting aside
                the 2008 crisis numbers, estimates for this
                calendar and the next by the IMF are the
                weakest since 2001.
                What do U.S. CEOs saying feel about
                the coming months?
                The Conference Board measure of CEO
                confidence showed top honchos in the
                West haven’t been this downbeat since the
                2007­2009 recession. The survey asked
                136 CEOs what economic conditions they
                are preparing to face over the next 12­18
                months. An overwhelming majority— 98%
                — said they were preparing for a U.S. reces
                sion; while 99% said they were preparing
                for an EU recession.
                What is the outlook for the Indian IT
                industry?
                The Indian IT services firms are among the
                largest employers in the organised sector
                and any global economic trend is bound to
                have an impact on their growth projections. Managements look at headcount
                numbers critically when they want to cut
                costs and protect profit margins as they
                are accountable to investors. Though there
                isn’t a discernible trend yet, there are a
                few signs which may signal what is to be
                expected in the next few months. All top
                companies except Wipro saw a rise in revenue and net profit. Wipro’s net profit
                slid 9% from a year earlier for the quarter
                ended September.
                The attrition rates, or the number of
                employees per 100 quitting on their own,
                of the top two firms, TCS and Infosys,
                show that these rates are still high, which
                means that there is enough business for
                the sector for competitors to draw away
                employees with promise of higher salar
                ies. At Infosys, the attrition rate declined
                marginally to 27.1% in July­September 2022
                from 28.4% in the previous April to June
                quarter; at TCS, the attrition rate crept up
                to 21.5% in the July­September quarter
                from 19.7% between April and June. As for
                operating profit margins (OPM), Infosys
                saw its OPM improve to 21.5% in July­September from 20% in April­June, but both 3­
                month and 6­month OPMs had dipped
                compared to a year earlier; TCS saw its
                OPM rates rise to 24% in the three months
                ended September compared to the last
                quarter (23.1%).
                Media reports have said that Infosys
                aims to pay out 65% of the variable pay to
                employees for the July­September quarter,
                compared with 70% in the April­June quarter, because of ‘pressure on margins’.
                What about start­ups?
                News of layoffs in the Indian start­up front
                is predominantly in EDtech, or the educational technology front. A lesser share of
                internet users visiting educational websites since the decline of the pandemic is
                cited as one reason. The Indian start­up
                layoff tracker by Inc42 showed that more
                than 15,700 employees had been laid off in
                2022 given tightening funding conditions.
                Byju’s, Chargebee, Cars24, Ola, Innovaccer, Udaan, Unacademy and Vedantu are
                names that have been in the news for
                layoffs, according to Inc42.
                What happened in India during
                earlier global recessions?
                During earlier global recessions, while
                companies seldom publicly announced
                layoffs, they would all look to ease out staff
                who were lower down the performance
                ladder. Companies that were in a particularly bad patch cut bench strength. Then
                again, if a person was about a month old
                on the bench (i.e., without projects), he or
                she may have been asked to sign up for
                some training courses etc. If the professional spent more than three months on
                the bench and had not landed a project,
                the system itself would ease him or her
                out. What happened in the aftermath of
                the 2008 recession that stretched well
                beyond 2­3 years is that companies would
                start slowing down headcount addition.
